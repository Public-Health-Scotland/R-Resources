# Posit Workbench and Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## Background

[Posit Team](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/team/) enterprise applications have been deployed for [Public Health Scotland (PHS)](https://publichealthscotland.scot/) on the [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) cloud computing platform.

Posit Workbench is an [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (IDE) for R and Python.  Posit Workbench has been configured with the following code editors:

* RStudio (the default development environment for R)
* JupyterLab (a Python development environment)
* Jupyter Notebook (a notebook-based Python development environment)
* VS Code (an extensible programming language-agnostic development environment)

## Purpose

This document aims to provide users of Posit Workbench with high-level information on

- [what VS Code is](#what-is-vs-code),
- [when you should use VS Code](#when-should-i-use-vs-code), and
- [how to use VS Code in Posit Workbench](#how-do-i-use-vs-code-in-posit-workbench).

## What is VS Code?

Visual Studio Code, more commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft.  It has built-in support for hundreds of programming languages, including both R and Python.  It has support for extensions to enhance Git workflows, automate code formatting and make debugging code easier.

## When should I use VS Code?

If you are primarily a non-R user, perhaps Python is your preferred language for Data Science, or you are building web apps, then VS Code may be a better solution for your needs than the default _RStudio_ code editor.

## How do I use VS Code in Posit Workbench?

Follow the guidance on logging in and starting a session published at [https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/R-Resources/blob/master/posit_workbench_login_guidance.md](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/R-Resources/blob/master/posit_workbench_login_guidance.md)

Make sure to select _VS Code_ as the editor.

### How do I close a VS Code session?

Navigate to the Posit Workbench homepage at [https://pwb.publichealthscotland.org/](https://pwb.publichealthscotland.org/) and click the _Quit_ button next to the VS Code session you want to close.
