# How to use

To use this template, download the repository as a zip file and save it to your local network. Alternatively, if you are using git, clone the repository. You can then edit the files and folders accordingly, e.g. rename the folders or files and update the README with a description of the presentation.

To view the slides, click the `Knit` button inside RStudio. A set of html slides will be created, which can be viewed within RStudio or opened in a browser. The slides can also be published to [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/), which is free and allows you to view your slides without R.

This template aims to instil best practice within PHI and therefore git has been initiliased for version control. However, if you are not 
using git then you can delete the .gitignore file. More information about [version control](https://github.com/NHS-NSS-transforming-publications/resources/blob/master/version-control.md).
